## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
The project aims to develop an **AI-driven financial literacy tutor** designed to deliver personalized, adaptive learning experiences for users with diverse backgrounds and needs.  

The work was structured into three specialized teams:  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Implemented a semantic search and question-answering system using Pinecone, OpenAI, and LangChain to provide accurate, source-cited answers from finance-related documents.  
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Built classification models to assess student progress and analyze learning behaviors, utilizing synthetic data generation, advanced embeddings, and machine learning algorithms with hyperparameter optimization.  
- **Software Engineering (SWE)**: Enhanced system usability by improving the frontend, implementing secure user authentication, and preparing the platform for production deployment.
