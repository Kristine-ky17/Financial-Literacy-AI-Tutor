      "Answer: Insurance is a contract, known as a policy, in which a policyholder receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company. The company pools the risks of its clients to make payments more affordable for the insured. This financial protection can cover losses resulting from accidents, injuries, property damage, or liability for damage or injury caused to a third party. Essentially, insurance helps to protect individuals and their families against unexpected financial costs, potential debts, and the risk of losing assets.\n",
